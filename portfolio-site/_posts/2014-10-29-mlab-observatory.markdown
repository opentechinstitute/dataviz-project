### About
The M-Lab Data Observatory provides a way to explore ISP performance across a number of metrics, locations, and time periods. It also allows a view into the way ISPsâ€™ connections with each other -- the interconnectedness that makes up the Internet -- shape performance. By selecting different options, you can see how various ISPs performance across a variety of metrics like upload or download speed, round trip time or packet retransmission rate. You can also see how these metrics differed over time, across locations, or relative to ISP interconnection relationships.
