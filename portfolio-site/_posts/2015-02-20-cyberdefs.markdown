### Cyber Definitions Database
The Global Cyber Definitions Database is part of New Americaâ€™s Global Cybersecurity Norms and Resilience Project which seeks to shape international cybersecurity norms and more resilient governance structures capable of effectively responding to accidents and malicious actors that do not adhere to norms.

This website houses over 900 cyber and information security related definitions from around the world and we are constantly looking to expand and update our database. Use the search bar above to explore the database.

To use advanced search, download data and reports, access more information about policy impact and sources, or to submit new definitions, click below.
