### About
New Americaâ€™s International Security Program is focused on providing evidence-based analysis of international security issues, including the rise of political Islam, U.S. counterterrorism operations, and cyber warfare. This data site houses all of the databases that the program has compiled in its effort to bring greater transparency to such issues. They are maintained and updated on a regular basis.
